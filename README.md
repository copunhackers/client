# client
 
 The connecting to the api's have been removed, as the keys are not valide anymore, which means,
 if you want to use it, you will have to actually find the api's and make reconnect them, 
 by making a new acoount and adding the new keys to the code.
 Meaning you will have to host the server yourself too. 


How it used to work:
To test the project, all you need to do, is download the client,
run it in android studio with your phone linked to your computer with a usb cabel.
Make sure your phone is in developer mode.
By then running it on your phone, it should ask for acces and then upload it to it and you should be able to try it out.
